Additional reasons include having my R / Python code in a clean and easy-to-navigate format, and to share recipes once in a while. I’ve been talking about wanting to have a blog since 2012, so I’m glad that I finally got around to having one in 2022.\nYou can reach out to me via LinkedIn or via email (my first name [dot] last name [at] gmail)."
