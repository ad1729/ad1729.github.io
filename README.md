This project contains all the files for the blog.

## Instructions (for my future self)

- Create a folder under `posts/` with the folder name indicating the slug of the post
- Create an `ignored.qmd` file in the newly created folder 
- Start writing
- When the post is ready for editing / proofreading, rename the file to `index.qmd`
- Run `quarto preview` in the terminal
- When satisfied with the result, send `Ctrl+C` to the terminal to cancel `quarto preview`
- Run `quarto render`
- Commit changes and push to master / main branch
- Run `quarto publish gh-pages`
- Go do something else
