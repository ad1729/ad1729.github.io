This project contains the all the files for the blog.

## Instructions (for my future self)

- Create a folder under `posts/` with the folder name indicating the slug of the post
- Create an `index.qmd` file in the newly created folder 
- Start writing
- Run `quarto preview` in the terminal 
- Run `quarto render` when done with the post
- Run `quarto publish gh-pages`
- Go do something else
